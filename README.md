Methods
```GDScript
init(is_for_child_directed_treatment := true, is_personalized := false, max_ad_content_rating := "G", instance_id := get_instance_id(), test_device_id := "") #init the AdMob

load_banner(gravity : int = GRAVITY.BOTTOM, size : String = "SMART_BANNER", unit_id : String = ad.banner.unit_id[OS.get_name()]) #load the banner will make him appear instantly
load_interstitial(unit_id: String = ad.interstitial.unit_id[OS.get_name()]) #loads the interstitial and make ready for show
load_rewarded(unit_id : String = ad.rewarded.unit_id[OS.get_name()]) #loads the rewarded and make ready for show

destroy_banner() #completely destroys the Banner View
destroy_unified_native() #completely destroys the Unified Native View

show_interstitial() #shows interstitial
show_rewarded() #shows rewarded

_on_AdMob_*() #just to emit signals
```
